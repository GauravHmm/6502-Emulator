# 6502-Emulator
6502 Emulator using python
#Yapping Alert
well well well,i only saw the first 2 pages of the document and went on to try to learn about processors and how to emulate one, on the last day it came to my attention that we have a seperate full page long instructions for it.anyways, i choose 6502 because making discord bot is common now(not that it is easy to do),but my original plan was to first learn what is 6502,microproccessors and how do they work, then il make a discord bot, but my multitasking had to go to e summit event as well, so i couldnt.

#Technical Update
on day 1 i watched n numbers of videos of 6502 and its processing, i started the code somewhere.
on day 2 i couldnt do much as i was in a day long event
on day 3 here i am trying to finish the work, i did add some functions.
day 4 was spent on academic stuff
day 5 im trying to make it work xo. well it is working now im slowly trying to make it complex and hopefully not hurt myself
