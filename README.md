# 6502-Emulator
6502 Emulator using python

#Yapping Alert

Well, well, well, I only saw the first two pages of the document and went on trying to learn about processors and how to emulate one. On the last day, it came to my attention that we have separate, full-page-long instructions for it. Anyway, I chose the 6502 because making Discord bots is common now (not that it is easy to do), but my original plan was to first learn what the 6502 and microprocessors are, and how they work. Then, I'd make a Discord bot. But my multitasking had to go to an e-summit event as well, so I couldn't.

#Technical Update

On day 1, I watched numerous videos of the 6502 and its processing. I started the code somewhere. On day 2, I couldn't do much as I was in a day-long event. On day 3, here I am trying to finish the work. I did add some functions. Day 4 was spent on academic stuff. On day 5, I'm trying to make it work. Well, it is working now, I'm slowly trying to make it more complex and hopefully not hurt my brain.
